## Getting started  
```
npm i rakkit
```
```
yarn add rakkit
```

## Documentation
The documentation is available [here](https://github.io/RaccoonCH/Rakkit).

## The project history  
Initially this tool was made in order to create a homemade Headless CMS. But as the project progressed, our needs grew and our backend application looked more and more like a Framework, so we choose to make it an independent tool to benefit the community and progress on a better basis.

## Philosophy  
We wanted to create a tool that would allow us to create backend applications much more simply with a small learning curve, so that anyone, with some TypeScript basics, could use it. We also didn't want to make a clone of NestJS.

## Features (Fully typed, Class based & Decorators)  
- Dependency injection support
- Rest API Creation ([koa](https://koajs.com/))
- Websocket app creation ([socket.io](https://socket.io/))

## The next step
We want to integrate the use of GraphQL in a near future, like [type-graphql](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql) does.

## Contributing  
You can simply clone the project and submit a pull request, we will analyze it and decide whether or not it is valid.
