# Demos
You have access to examples in the [examples](https://github.com/RaccoonCH/Rakkit/tree/master/examples/) folder of the project, for the moment there are not many of them...  
For graphql the behavior of our package is almost the same as that of type-graphql, in some cases you can use the examples provided by it: [here](https://typegraphql.ml/docs/examples.html).  
You can then submit your application to us by [Gitter](https://gitter.im/_rakkit_/community) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/McygUJb) so that we can reference it.
