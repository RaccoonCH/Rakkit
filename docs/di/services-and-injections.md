# Service and injection (Dependency injection)

## Service
First of all, it should be noted that the decorators below implicitly declare themselves as a service, so there is no need to redeclare them using `@Service`:
- @Router
- @Websocket
- @BeforeMiddleware
- @AfterMiddleware
- _@Service_

## Injection

### Basic
In this example the same instance (having an ID) of class _A_ will be injected into _B_ and _C_.
```typescript
@Service()
class A {
  MyValue = "hello world";
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class B {
  @Inject()
  private _a: A;

  constructor() {
    // By doing this the instance of A in class C is also affected
    this._a.MyValue = "I'm on the B service";
  }
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class C {
  @Inject()
  private _a: A;
}
```

### Multiple instances
In this example we declare two instances of class _A_ with different IDs that we can inject into our classes by specifying the ID.
```typescript
@Service(1, "a")
class A {
  MyValue = "hello world";
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class B {
  @Inject(1)
  private _a: A;

  constructor() {
    // By doing this the instance of A in class C is NOT affected,
    // because they are two instances of different classes.
    this._a.MyValue = "I'm on the B service";
  }
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class C {
  @Inject("a")
  private _a: A;
}
```

### Array injection
By repeating the previous example, we can also inject several services into the same variable, which will give an instance array of the injected class.  
In this case we are forced to **declare explicitly the type in the injection** in the first parameter because TypeScript (reflect-metadata) does not allow me to know the type of a table.
```typescript
@Service(1, "a")
class A {
  MyValue = "hello world";
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class B {
  @Inject(type => A, 1, "a")
  private _as: A[];

  constructor() {
    // By doing this the instance of A in class C is affected,
    // because _as[1] refers to the instance of A with the ID: "a"
    this._as[1].MyValue = "I'm on the B service";
  }
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class C {
  @Inject("a")
  private _a: A;
}
```

### Constructor injection
Another way to inject a dependency, which is by the constructor, can be used.  
It works the same way, but with this notation you don't have to decorate the injection if it is simple ( simple = @Inject() ).  
However, you will not be able to **do circular injection** with this method unlike with property injection, this is explained in [below](/di/limitations/#circular-dependencies) and that is why we recommend property injection.
```typescript
@Service()
@Service("a")
class A {
  MyValue = "hello world";
}
```
```typescript
@Service()
class B {
  constructor(
    private _a: A; // No need to decorate this parameter with @Inject
    @Inject(1)
    private _a1: A;
  ) {}
}
```
